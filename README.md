## Dev Toolbox

A small application that puts an icon in the system tray that when clicked, shows a dropdown of Atom, VSCode, iTerm, Chrome and Firefox so you have easy access to these apps all the time.

Shortcuts are also configured:
- Atom     -> Cmd + A
- VSCode   -> Cmd + V
- iTerm    -> Cmd + I
- Chrome   -> Cmd + C
- Firefox  -> Cmd + F
