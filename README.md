## Dev Toolbox

A small application that puts an icon in the system tray that when clicked, shows a dropdown of Atom, VSCode, iTerm, Chrome and Firefox so you have easy access to these apps all the time.

Shortcuts are also configured:
- Atom -> Cmd + A
- VSCode -> Cmd + V
- iTerm -> Cmd + I
- Google Chrome -> Cmd + C
- Firefox -> Cmd + F
